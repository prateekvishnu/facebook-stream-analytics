When I raised formal complaint for prolonged poor/no connectivity wherein neither callers can't reach me (\"Outside of network coverage\" message) on my cell phone, nor I can make calls. And if by chance call gets connected, it drops several times. This is going on for last more than 8 weeks. I am a corporate customer and so called \"Premium\" customer of Airtel. God only knows what premium do I get. In fact, I am paying premium price to Airtel for nothing in return, not even basic voice and data (2G/3G) connectivity.  The customer care is trained to give stereotyped responses. They are hopeless and accept the fault, but show no courtesy to commit to resolve the issue or compensate for loss of service. Rather they are shameless to ask for disconnecting the line if I'm not happy with the service.   This is quite apart from billing discrepancies wherein excess amounts were charged on a/c of so called excess data consumption. When a complaint was raised there was a blunt refusal. Only after giving proofs of data consumption well within limits, the excess charges were agreed upon and reversed. So, I now need to keep proofs of everything. This has happened 3 times. Airtel doesn't understand what ethical billing means.   Looks like Airtel has got too many customers. Time to change.

In April, when 25 days of the month passed, we received a message that we have exceeded 10GB usage and speed was reduced to negligible. We were forced to upgrade to 1249.00 (15GB) package. In May, when 25 days were passed, we received a message that we have exceeded 15 GB usage and further usage will be charged @ Rs. 200.00 per GB. We were billed for Rs. 1775.00. In June, when just 7 days of the month had passed we received a message that 13 GB of 15 GB stand used. This is ridiculous, sheer fleecing. We are hardly using Airtel 4G on our Laptops but using it only on mobiles for whatsapp.  Earlier, we had just 1 GB BSNL connection and 1 GB data usage never exceeded despite month long use of it on our mobiles. Whatsapp ran fine with BSNL also, only speed was little slower than 4G but tolerable. Though we are now closing 4G connection and switching back to BSNL, this incident should prove an eye opener for all 4G users who are likely to face similar treatment. The joy that better speed of 4G Airtel brought proved shortlived only.  Sushma Goyall","createdAt":"2015-06-13T04:03:00+0000","tag":"FB","lang":"en"}

Besides the numerous call drops This is forced denial of voice service for a mobile connection with no pending bills making the whole purpose of having a mobile connection void.

I called their care department twice wrt issues with my 4G # 8861759696. When I called around 9:45AM I spoke with an agent who was not completely aware of a complaint number 65836132. When I asked for his supervisor / manager he said that they were all busy and offered a callback in 4 hrs. True to Airtel standards this callback never happened, I called again around 2:30PM reached a lady agent who offered to transfer the call to a supervisor. After about 6 minutes listening to their lousy hold music the call was picked up by another agent who was more than happy to transfer the line to a supervisor / manager. Another 5+ minutes of hold music before I reached someone who called himself a supervisor and confirmed that he had my Airtel 4G number in front of him. This guy was equally clueless and wanted me to verify my details ( name / contact number / address ) once again though the 1st lady already took those details. His logic is that they have 4 Shankers in their records - as though it was my parents' mistake in naming me Shanker. When I asked him to transfer the call to his manager, the line got disconnected. The same thing happened when I spoke with their regulator's team this morning. My case worker was desperate to get off the call ( as though he was packing up and leaving for a job interview ). When I asked him for his manager's name, he put me on hold for 2 to 3 minutes before coming back with a lady's name. I did not callback and ask for her - for all I know, she must have jumped the ship herself.

Kudos Airtel, Good tag line in your advertisement, Airtel 4g has indeed become a big challenge for us to activate 4g & use the internet.   So, here is my horror story.   October 15th 2015.   Bought 4g hotspot with sim number 91XXXXX249 on Thursday October 15th 2015. Along with the form gave the passport copy as personal ID & address proof & a photograph.   October 16th 2015.  Some one from Airtel called up for ID verification on 16th Oct. But I was in office, told him to come to office for which he refused. So, asked him to come the next morning around 10:00 am to residence.   October 17th 2015.   Airtel representative came for verification on 17th Oct 2015 at 11:30 am.  The representative said verification is done, asked to call the toll free number for activation & would be done in next 10 minutes. :)          Read on interesting part starts here.   When we called for activation, was told that my name is not matching their records. This inspite of giving passport copy & a personal verification done. I should have known about your incompetency then. Was asked rudely to go to the dealer from where the hotspot was bought to rectify the name issue.  Went to the dealer at around 12:30 pm the same day, the name entered was wrong inspite of giving a passport copy(INCOMPETENCE). You guys should be proud of your process. The name entered was Shobha Gajanur Jain.  The dealer spoke to the airtel customer care & said it was rectified & 4g would be activated in 10 mins. 10 mins :), seems to be a favourite Airtel time.  Was patient the whole day, didn’t work the entire day.   October 18th 2015  Called up customer care the next day 18th Oct, was told 4g might not be activated. Was asked to wait again for 24 hours to get it activated. The only thing that needs to get activated is Airtel’s shoddy process & customer handling process. There was no ticket number given for all the calls done. Might have done some 10 calls to your customer care number 1800103405 till now.   October 19th, 20th 2015  have been frequently calling on 19th, 20th. Was told might be a handset problem & would send someone to check this up. A ticket was finally opened now, with number 65803080.   October 21st 2015  21st Oct 2015 - God's great, someone called me & said an Engineer will come to rectify a 4g hotspot hardware problem in next 24 hours. Sounds funny. :) Have been almost 6 days now.   October 22nd 2015  22nd Oct 2015 - No update, called Airtel customer care. The status is “There is some technical problem, the backend team is looking at it”. In proper english this means, “Ha ha ha. You are stuck with us, there is no way out now. Will grind you with our incompetence”  So, it goes on.","createdAt":"2015-10-22T08:21:17+0000","tag":"FB","lang":"en"}

For new connection, they may come on Saturday/Sunday also but for resolving the complaints, they want 4 days and take 10 days to respond. Forget resolving the problem.  The managers are rude enough to say \"YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OPTION AND YOU HAVE TO WAIT\" even after so many days of filing the complaint. Should one just take off from office and sit ideal at home because \"we have to wait for more than a month\" and still no resolution of the complaint.

Each time i call customer care, they tell me different different problems. Some time they say there is an issue in back end etc. I can't understand what kind of services you are providing. Certainly this is my the worst experience with Airtel. Today it's 7th day and my issue is still not resolved.

During the last month I twice applied for UPC code and approached Airtel for new connection under portability. Inspite of more than 20 calls, two visits at their store and several e-mails , my number has not been activated. Every time I call I am told new story. The SIM delivered at my residence by the channel partner of Airtel. After all sort of verification I am told that there is mismatch of SIM number. How come different SIM came into picture. When new SIM has not been delivered to me , who entered the different SIM number into the system ? What is my fault? Who is responsible for expiry of validity period of UPC code when I first applied ? The delay in processing was on the part of Airtel. I am totally disgusted with the quality of service of Airtel . I advise the general public never go to Airtel for portability of your number to Airtel.  Renu Arora M-9999885591","createdAt":"2015-07-02T15:32:52+0000","tag":"FB","lang":"en"}
